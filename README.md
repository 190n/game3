# Game3
A 2D game made in OpenGL. Game engines are for cowards.

## Credits
Huge thanks to [Shade](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/) for creating [Mini World Sprites](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/16x16-mini-world-sprites),
which features heavily in this project, and for creating custom anvil and furnace tiles at my request.

Thanks to Tilation for their [indoor tileset](https://tilation.itch.io/16x16-small-indoor-tileset).

Thanks to [Vadim](https://github.com/Vadimuh) for the flower sprite.
