# Game3
A 2D game made in OpenGL. Made without an engine because I'd prefer to do things my own way.

## Credits
Huge thanks to [Shade](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/) for creating [Mini World Sprites](https://merchant-shade.itch.io/16x16-mini-world-sprites),
which features heavily in this project, and for creating custom anvil and furnace tiles at my request.

Thanks to Tilation for their [indoor tileset](https://tilation.itch.io/16x16-small-indoor-tileset).

Thanks to [Vadim](https://github.com/Vadimuh), [Fayabella](https://github.com/Fayabella) and [Bamboozle.jpg](https://github.com/Bamboozle-jpg) for their flower sprites.
